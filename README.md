# mongoose_file-server
Minimalistic file server with upload, based on https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/tree/master/examples/simplest_web_server.
Additions in comparesment to the original:
- file upload feature to currently browsed folder
- no "Index of" in title, but actual path to folder being served
- parent folder link
